- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I wanted to practice working with hooks and API in React. Even tho I didn't get to practice with all the hooks I had in mind beforehand, I got to shape my react mental model better by utilizing what I've been watching in lectures for the past few days.


### Continued development

I will keep on practicing and learning React. This is just the beginning of my React journey. I'm also planning on learning Redux and TypeScript in the very near future.
